- 👋😄 Hi, I’m @poeyahay
  I'm a medical master student at the **Amsterdam UMC (location, AMC)**.
  Currently diving into the intersection of **Genetics** and **Cardiovascular Disease**.  
- 🧬💡 What I'm working on
  I'm particularly interested in improving **Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS)** for heart conditions, with a current focus on **Atrial Fibrillation**.
  I'm combining medical knowledge with data-driven methods to improve prediction of diseases based on DNA.
- 🛠️ Tools & Skills
  Learning and working with: **`R`, `bash`, `PLINK`, and some `Python`**.
  Actively using statistical genetics tools and PRS methods.
  Exploring large-scale biobank data **(like UK Biobank and All of Us)**.
- ⚡ About me
  Just started programming a few months ago — and I'm loving it!
  Curious by nature, always eager to learn and improve.
  Enjoy combining biomedical science with real-world data.
